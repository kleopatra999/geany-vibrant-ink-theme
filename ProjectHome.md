I really liked the Vibrant Ink theme for Textmate, but I use Linux and the Geany text editor. I noticed Notepad++ had their own port of it, so I ported the [entire theme](Supported_Filetypes.md) to Geany. I've made some modifications in order to keep a consistency with the original Textmate theme.

I've posted it here to share with others who are interested. Enjoy!
